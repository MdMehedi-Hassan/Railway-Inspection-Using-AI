Railway Inspection Using AI 🚆🤖
This project leverages artificial intelligence to automate the inspection of railway tracks, ensuring safety, efficiency, and reduced human intervention. Using cutting-edge computer vision techniques and deep learning, this system detects and analyzes railway track conditions from images captured during inspection.

📌 Features
Railway Track Inspection: Detect cracks, misalignments, and other irregularities on tracks.
YOLO-based Annotation: Utilize YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and annotation of railway images.
Dataset Management: Process and annotate images into a structured dataset for training and testing models.
Integration with Kaggle: Dataset uploaded and trained in Kaggle for collaborative research and model development.
Mobile Image Collection: Easily capture railway images using a smartphone for field deployment.
